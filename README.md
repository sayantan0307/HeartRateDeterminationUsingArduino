# Heart_Rate_Determination_Using_Arduino
Project on how to measure heart rate, using an Arduino, simple heart rate sensor and MATLAB.

Components needed for the project:

1. Arduino UNO
2. Hyperterminal Application
3. Pulse Heart Rate Sensor

First download and open the PPG_Data_Collection.pptx file. Follow the instructions as given in the file. The Arduino code is available in the file PPG_Data.ino. It's a simple code and can be written directly too. The method of using Hyperterminal has been mentioned in the ppt.
